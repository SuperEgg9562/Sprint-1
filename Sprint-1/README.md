# Sprint-1
The Command-Line Interface allows you to essentially talk to a computer
operating system and/or computer application via special commands.

Here are some of those commands used to communicate via the Command-Line
Interface.

1. cd - change directory : changes the folder.
2. mkdir - make directory : makes folder.
3. rmdir - remove directory : deletes folder.
4. cd ~ - home directory : takes you to the start folder(safe folder).
5. pwd - print working directory : shows what folder you are in.
6. ls - list : lists the contents of folder.
7. cp - copy command : copies files from one location to another.
8. mv - move command : moves files from one location to another.
9. git clone : initiates a clone operation : duplicates a bucket-like file from
   git hub puts it in a folder of your choice.
10. exit - exits command-line : escapes from command-line interface.
